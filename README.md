3 STEPS TO BUILD YOUR REACT NATIVE APPS FASTER :)
As a solo developer (not a designer), i think that these things can help you build your own app better and save your time.
1. The first step in building a mobile app is to choose a design that inspires you.
--> go to dribbble.com or behance.net to search keywords that you want to build. 
--> or go to websites that collect Design Inspiration like collectui.com , muz.li
2. Getting started, using React Native app templates
It can save your development work including step-by-step documentation on these templates.
- finding code examples on github easily:
